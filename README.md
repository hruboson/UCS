# UCS
UCS algorithm for 10x10 matrix of nodes.
This short program was created for my personal use to check correction of an assignment. There is probably a ton of errors for all kinds of inputs. Nothing was tested.

## Usage
Change the matrix on line 32-41 for your desired matrix of nodes. Z means unreachable node (*wall*).

## Run
`python ucs.py`
